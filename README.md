Exploratory data analysis with a Feature store using Hopsworks

## What is Hopsworks?
Hopsworks is a data platform for ML with a Python-centric Feature Store and MLOps capabilities. Hopsworks is a modular platform. You can use it as a standalone Feature Store, you can use it to manage, govern, and serve your models, and you can even use it to develop and operate feature pipelines and training pipelines. Hopsworks brings collaboration for ML teams, providing a secure, governed platform for developing, managing, and sharing ML assets - features, models, training data, batch scoring data, logs, and more.

To install Hopsworks locally:

```python
!pip install -U hopsworks --quiet
```
